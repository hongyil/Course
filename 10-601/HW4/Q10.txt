Train and test a decision tree for the politician dataset and the education dataset. Which is moreaccurate on the training data? Which is more accurate on the testing data?

Case 1: politician

Command: python decisionTree.py hw4data/politicians_train.csv hw4data/politicians_test.csv 
Result: error(train): 0.140939597315
	error(test): 0.156626506024

Case 2: Education

Command: python decisionTree.py hw4data/education_train.csv hw4data/education_test.csv 
Result: error(train): 0.195
	error(test): 0.23

So I think politician is more accurate on train data, education is more accurate on training data
